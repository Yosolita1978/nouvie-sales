## 2026-01-27

**Done**
- Created `prisma/backup-orders.ts` - Script to export all orders to CSV backup
- Created `prisma/reset-database.ts` - Script to clear all data (respecting FK constraints)
- Updated `prisma/seed.ts` with new admin credentials
- Ran full database refresh with new customer and product data from client
- Updated `app/page.tsx` - Added landing page with "Ir al Dashboard" link
- Improved inventory alerts on `/products` page - Now shows category breakdown (e.g., "5 ETIQUETAS AGOTADOS" instead of generic "5 Productos AGOTADOS")

**Decisions**
- Database reset sequence: order_items → orders → customers → products (respects FK constraints)
- Backup script creates timestamped CSV files in `prisma/backups/`
- New admin user configured (credentials stored securely, not in repo)
- Home page simplified to just show Nouvie branding + dashboard link

**Blocked/Waiting**
- None

**Learned**
- Prisma deleteMany respects FK constraints, must delete in correct order
- Product categories in data: Etiquetas, Envases, Productos, Merchandising, Otros

**Next**
- Deploy changes to Vercel
- Verify new data appears correctly in production
- Consider adding backup script to regular maintenance workflow
